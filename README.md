## About the Dataset

Olist is an ecommerce marketplace in Brazil. This project is based on 100,000 sales orders made from multiple marketplaces in Brazil, from 2016 to 2018, with product, customer and review information, among other variables. The original data was provided in multiple datasets, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?resource=download).

For convinience, I have combined the CSV files into one excel workbook. The combined workbook was used for this project, and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1mDL1BQMHqTRYyLMshGwaOkvjJ3nKX8rl). You will also find a detailed description of each dataset.
